# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

Data Visualization Insights

ðŸ“Š 1) Distribution of Numerical Variables (Histograms)
Rating: Normally distributed, centered around 4.0.

Reviews: Positively skewed, with most hotels having fewer reviews but a few with very high numbers (outliers).

Star Rating: Concentrated around 4 stars with slight variation.

Distance to Landmark: Broad distribution, indicating hotels are spread across Munnar with varying proximities to landmarks.

Price: Right-skewed distribution, suggesting most hotels have lower prices, but some premium hotels have significantly higher rates.

Tax: Similar right-skewed pattern, with most taxes being low but some high outliers.

ðŸ“‰ 2) Box Plots for Outlier Detection
Reviews and Price have the most noticeable outliers.

Tax also shows several outliers, indicating a few hotels with unusually high taxes.

Distance to Landmark shows a fairly even spread with no significant outliers.

Rating and Star Rating have minor outliers but remain relatively consistent.

ðŸ”¥ 3) Correlation Heatmap
Price and Tax: Strong positive correlation, as expected. Higher-priced hotels typically have higher taxes.

Reviews and Rating: Slight positive correlation, indicating higher-rated hotels tend to have more reviews.

Distance to Landmark shows a weak correlation with other variables, suggesting location doesn't significantly impact price or rating.

Star Rating and Price: Mild positive correlation, indicating higher-rated hotels tend to be more expensive.
